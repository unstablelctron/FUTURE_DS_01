🚀 Sales & Customer Insights — Data Analytics Project

Future Interns | Task 1 Completed

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes transactional sales and customer data to uncover revenue drivers, customer concentration risks, geographic performance patterns, and seasonal demand trends.
The goal is to move beyond surface-level revenue numbers and translate data into actionable business insights that support strategic decision-making.

📊 Business Snapshot

Total Revenue: 8.3M

Total Transactions: 22.1K

Business Model: High-volume, low-price

Primary Market: UK (volume-driven)

High-Value Segment: International bulk buyers

🔍 Key Insights

Revenue Concentration Risk
A significant share of revenue is generated by a small group of top customers, indicating dependency on bulk buyers rather than a diversified customer base.

Geographic Value Gap
While the UK dominates total revenue, non-UK countries show the highest Average Order Value (AOV)—fewer transactions but substantially higher order sizes.

Customer Behavior Pattern
International customers behave as bulk buyers, contributing high-value orders with lower purchase frequency.

Seasonality Trend
Sales peak sharply in Q3, followed by a decline in Q4, suggesting seasonal demand—likely influenced by festive or peak buying cycles in non-UK markets.

💡 Business Recommendations

Monetize High-Value International Customers
Introduce bundle pricing, volume-based discounts, and loyalty programs tailored to bulk buyers to increase retention and order value.

Reduce Revenue Dependency Risk
Diversify the customer base by developing mid-tier customer segments instead of relying heavily on a few top buyers.

Smarter Inventory Planning
Align stock availability with seasonal demand—especially pre-Q3—to prevent stockouts during peak periods and overstocking in slower quarters.
